      <h2> Why did I choose to go to Le Wagon?</h2>
      <p>For a long time now I was thinking about finding some part-time classes regarding web development in order to find a a job in this area. But no classes of that kind where available. 
        <br> So I stopped thinking about it for a time because anyway I didn't have the money at this point to start the program. <br>
        Now I'm glad that I can do this program thanks to "Le wagon" and continue to work and maybe in March find new opportunities in web development :).

      <h2> My dreams</h2>
      <p>I have a lot of dreams coming along with this program at Le Wagon. Here is the list I've made:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Surf more</li>
        <li>Build a small mini van</li>
        <li>Dedicate myself to projects which passionates me! (it's not the case today)</li>
        <li>Have a better balance between my profesional life and my private life ==> Be happier</li>
      </ul>
